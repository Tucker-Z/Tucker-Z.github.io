          "On June 20, 1947, the Bumper Program was inaugurated. This was a co-operative program established among the agencies responsible for the various phases of the basic programs. The purpose of this program was to investigate launching techniques for a two-stage missile and separation of the two stages at high velocity, to conduct limited investigation of high-speed high-altitude phenomena, and to attain velocities and altitudes higher than ever reached."  <br>- White Sands Missile Range (Web.archive.org) <br>
          <br>"Eight rockets were launched during the Bumper program between May 13, 1948 to July 29, 1950."  - Wikipedia

        <h1>The deadly flaw with Apollo 1 </h1><h5>When it came time for testing, the Apollo 1 was being run through some routine exercises. When the cabin suddenly caught on fire, killing everyone inside, the engineers had to make some design changes in order to ensure a safe flight to the moon. </h5> <h4>Click to find out more!</h4>

        <h1>The Van Allen Radiation Belt </h1><h5>When our first rocket went up, Explorer 1, it had one simple task. To find any sort of stragne particle in our atmosphere. That is exactly what it found. </h5> <h4>Click to find out more!</h4>

          "The primary science instrument on Explorer 1 was a cosmic ray detector designed to measure the radiation environment in Earth orbit. Once in space this experiment, provided by Dr. James Van Allen of the State University of Iowa, revealed a much lower cosmic ray count than expected. Van Allen theorized that the instrument may have been saturated by very strong radiation from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by Earth's magnetic field. The existence of these radiation belts was confirmed by another U.S. satellite launched two months later, and they became known as the Van Allen Belts in honor of their discoverer." - jpl.NASA.gov <br></br>

          Here is a precise definition of what it actually is: <br>

          "A radiation belt is a layer of energetic charged particles that is held in place around a magnetized planet, such as the Earth, by the planet's magnetic field. The Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created."  - Wikipedia

          <br></br>

          Seeing that these belts were a danger to the men and the equipment, NASA tried to minimize the effect of it. <br>

          "The Apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts, bypassing inner belts completely." - Wikipedia
