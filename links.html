          "On June 20, 1947, the Bumper Program was inaugurated. This was a co-operative program established among the agencies responsible for the various phases of the basic programs. The purpose of this program was to investigate launching techniques for a two-stage missile and separation of the two stages at high velocity, to conduct limited investigation of high-speed high-altitude phenomena, and to attain velocities and altitudes higher than ever reached."  <br>- White Sands Missile Range (Web.archive.org) <br>
          <br>"Eight rockets were launched during the Bumper program between May 13, 1948 to July 29, 1950."  - Wikipedia

        <h1>The deadly flaw with Apollo 1 </h1><h5>When it came time for testing, the Apollo 1 was being run through some routine exercises. When the cabin suddenly caught on fire, killing everyone inside, the engineers had to make some design changes in order to ensure a safe flight to the moon. </h5> <h4>Click to find out more!</h4>

          "This failure in communications forced a hold of the countdown at 5:40 p.m. By 6:31 the test conductors were about ready to pick up the count when ground instruments showed an unexplained rise in the oxygen flow into the spacesuits. One of the crew, presumably Grissom, moved slightly.

          Four seconds later, an astronaut, probably Chaffee, announced almost casually over the intercom: "Fire, I smell fire." Two seconds later, Astronaut White's voice was more insistent: "Fire in the cockpit." <br></br> The intense heat and dense smoke drove one after another back, but finally they succeeded. Unfortunately, it was too late. The astronauts were dead. Firemen arrived within three minutes of the hatch opening, doctors soon thereafter. A medical board determined that the astronauts died of carbon monoxide asphyxia, with thermal burns as contributing causes. The board could not say how much of the burns came after the three had died. Fire had destroyed 70% of Grissom's spacesuit, 20% of White's and 15% of Chaffee's. Doctors treated 27 men for smoke inhalation. Two were hospitalized."  <br> -AirandSpace.si.edu <br></br> "Chagrined, NASA and the companies building the Apollo spacecraft got to work. The flammable oxygen environment for ground tests was replaced with a nitrogen-oxygen mix. Flammable items were removed. A new respect developed between the astronauts and the contractors concerning design changes, which were implemented more effectively. Most notably, the door was completely redesigned so that it would open in mere seconds when the crew needed to get out in a hurry." - space.com

        <h1>Moon Dust!</h1><h5>The success of the Apollo 11 missions is undenieable. With the scientific equipment it was leaving behind, Earthy would be able to collect tons of data about the moon for years to come. But why did these insturments end up failing earlier than expect.

          "The first astronauts to walk on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s were inundated by sticky lunar dust that clung to their spacesuits whenever they ventured outside." - space.com <br></br> "There was significant contamination of astronaut-deployed hardware by kicked-up lunar material. So much so that the spray of debris caused by the departing rocket motor led to the overheating and early failure of Apollo 11?s Passive Seismic Experiment - the first major scientific experiment put on the moon by human hands."  -  space.com

        <h1>The Van Allen Radiation Belt </h1><h5>When our first rocket went up, Explorer 1, it had one simple task. To find any sort of stragne particle in our atmosphere. That is exactly what it found. </h5> <h4>Click to find out more!</h4>

          "The primary science instrument on Explorer 1 was a cosmic ray detector designed to measure the radiation environment in Earth orbit. Once in space this experiment, provided by Dr. James Van Allen of the State University of Iowa, revealed a much lower cosmic ray count than expected. Van Allen theorized that the instrument may have been saturated by very strong radiation from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by Earth's magnetic field. The existence of these radiation belts was confirmed by another U.S. satellite launched two months later, and they became known as the Van Allen Belts in honor of their discoverer." - jpl.NASA.gov <br></br>

          Here is a precise definition of what it actually is: <br>

          "A radiation belt is a layer of energetic charged particles that is held in place around a magnetized planet, such as the Earth, by the planet's magnetic field. The Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created."  - Wikipedia

          <br></br>

          Seeing that these belts were a danger to the men and the equipment, NASA tried to minimize the effect of it. <br>

          "The Apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts, bypassing inner belts completely." - Wikipedia
