### The early years of the American Space programm was always one step behind the Soviet Union's program. 
    
>“History changed on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik I. The world's first artificial satellite was about the size of a beach ball (58 cm.or 22.8 inches in diameter), weighed only 83.6 kg. or 183.9 pounds, and took about 98 minutes to orbit the Earth on its elliptical path. That launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments. While the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the space age and the U.S.-U.S.S.R space race.”- “Sputnik and The Dawn of the Space Age” from nasa.gov
    
### The U.S.A was not far behind because...

### The First American Space Craft
##### Just some more information on the Explorer 1 rocket

>"Explorer 1 was the first satellite launched by the United States when it was sent into space on January 31, 1958. Following the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency was directed to launch a satellite using its Jupiter C rocket developed under the direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory received the assignment to design, build and operate the artificial satellite that would serve as the rocket's payload. JPL completed this job in less than three months." -Nasa.gov

### The First Maned Space Craft
#### The Soviet Union, once again beat the U.S.A. to putting the first Human in Space

>"The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 ("East 1"), carrying 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. - Wikipedia

#### And in an interview with Life magazine, Yuri Gagarin describes his view...

>“I saw for the first time the earth's shape. I could easily see the shores of continents, islands, great rivers, folds of the terrain, large bodies of water. The horizon is dark blue, smoothly turning to black. . . the feelings which filled me I can express with one word: joy.” — Yuri A. Gagarin, Life magazine, 21 April 1961.

#### Not even a month later, the US sent its first man into space

>"On 5 May 1961, a Restone rocket lifted a Mercury Capsule to a distance of 300 miles (480 km) and a height of 113 miles (180 km) above the survace of the Earth. The capsule carried astronaut Alan B Shepard Jr."  - E John & Nancy Dewaard

### Space Craft

1. Install Jekyll
2. Fork or [download](https://github.com/arnp/herring-cove/archive/master.zip) this theme repo
3. Edit the `_config.yml` file

You can change the showcase image by replacing `showcase.jpg` file in the `images` folder. I'll try to find a better way to do this soon.
